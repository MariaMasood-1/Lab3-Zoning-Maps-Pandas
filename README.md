# Lab3: Zoning Maps Pandas

This script uses geographic shapefiles and data from DCâ€™s open data portal, and then concatenate datasets and conduct some basic analysis. After translating the maps into tables and running some analysis using pandas and geopandas library, we have created a map of Planning Unit Developments by zoning category. The goal of this lab is to gather some open data about zoning in D.C. and create a map of zoning exemptions and to consider the pivotal questions: Can we categorize and visualize buildings that received a zoning exemption in Washington, DC?

Pandas is one the python library which has functions similar to excel. Pandas data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. Pandas makes it easier to interact with tabular structures and run multiple operations on them.
